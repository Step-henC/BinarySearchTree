    //Binary Search Tree Practice

    //Trees consists of roots (parent node) and then children

    //A Heap: root has relationship but children but children have no
        //relationship with each other

    //Mini heap has smallest element at root
    //root or parent are smaller than children in mini heap but order does not matter

    //Max Heap is opposite of mini Heap with largest element as the root

    //Find children in max heap multiply parent index by child index for first child then add parent child 1 to the product to get second child

    //Use indexing to find parent
            //to get Node's parent, take index num and divide by 2

    //Binary search tree

    //children have relationships

    //left child node is less than root and right child node is greater than root
    //find parent: take index num and divide by two to get parent index
    //to find left node from root: root index * two
    //to find right node from root: root index * two + 1;
